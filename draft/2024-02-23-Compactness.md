## Sequentially Compact Space

${ X }$ is sequentially compact if every sequence of points in ${ X }$ has a convergent subsequence. 

## Heine-Borel Property

If ${ \{  V_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha \in J} }$ is an open covering of ${ K }$, there is a finite subset ${ F \subset J }$ such that ${ \{ V_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha \in F} }$ covers ${ K }$.
