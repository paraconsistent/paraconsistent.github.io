Let ${ X \neq \emptyset }$. ${ d: X \times X \to [0,\infty) }$ called quasi-metric on ${ X }$ if
- ${ d(x,y)=0 \mbox{ iff } x=y }$
- ${ d(x,y) \le d(x,z) + d(z,y) }$ for all ${ x,y,z \in X }$

The difference between a metric and quasi-metric is that a quasi-metric does not possess the symmetry axiom:

$$ d(x,y) = d(y,x) $$
