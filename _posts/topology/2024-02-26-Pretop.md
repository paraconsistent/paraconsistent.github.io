A **neighborhood system** for a pretopology on ${ X }$ is a system of [filters](https://paraconsistent.github.io/logic/2024/02/23/Filters-and-Nets.html#filters-and-ideals)

$$ \{ \mathcal{N}(x) : x \in X \} $$

- A member of ${ \mathcal{N}(x) }$ will be called a **neighborhood** of ${ x }$.
- A set ${ X }$ equipped with such a neighborhood system is called a **pretopological space**.
