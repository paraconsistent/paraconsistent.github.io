## ${ \ast }$-ring

**Definition** **${ \ast }$-ring** is a ring ${ A }$ with a map ${ ^{\ast}: A \to A }$ that is an [involutive antiautomorphism](https://paraconsistent.github.io/category-theory/2024/02/09/antihomomorphism.html).

## ${ \ast }$-algebra


**Definition** ${ \ast }$-algebra A is a ${ \ast }$-ring with involution ${ \ast }$ that is an associative algebra over a commutative ${ \ast }$-ring ${ R }$ with involution ' s.t.

$$ (\forall r \in R,\forall x \in A) \quad \left( rx \right)^{\ast} = r'x^{\ast} $$

## ${ \ast }$-homomorphism

**Definition** A ${ \ast }$-homomorphism ${ f:A\to B }$ is an algebra homomorphism that is compatible with the involutions of ${ A }$ and ${ B }$ i.e.,

$$ (\forall a \in A) \quad f(a^{\ast}) = f(a)^{\ast} $$
