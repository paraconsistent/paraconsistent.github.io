## Theorem

Let ${ \{ f\_{n} \} }$ be a sequence of measurable functions ${ X }$, and suppose that

$$ 0 \le f\_{1} \le f\_{2} \le \dots $$

and ${ f\_{n} \to f }$.

Then ${ f }$ is measurable, and

$$ \int\_{X} f\_{n} \, \mathrm{d}\mu \to \int\_{X} f\, \mathrm{d}\mu$$

## proof

$$ \int\_{X} f\_{n}  \to \alpha$$

as ${ n\to \infty }$ for some ${ \alpha \in [0, \infty] }$
