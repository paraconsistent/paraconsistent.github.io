## Accuracy and precision

### ISO 5725

#### test result
value of a characteristic obtained by carrying out a specified test method

#### accuracy
closeness of agreement between a test result and the true value

#### precision
closeness of agreement between independent test results obtained under stipulated conditions

#### trueness
closeness of agreement between the expectation of test results and a true value

#### bias
difference between the expectation of the test results and a true value

## Rounding

Rounding means replaceing a number with an approximate value that has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation.

### Rounding to a specified multiple

Rounding a number ${ x }$ to a multiple of some specified positive value ${ m }$

$$ \mathrm{roundToMultiple}(x,m) = \mathrm{round}\left( \frac{x}{m} \right) \times m $$

### Logarithmic rounding
